The Deep History of Postwar Global Capitalism
---

This project aims at describing and explaining the essential trends or _deep history_ of postwar global capitalist society.  Here, postwar global capitalist society is regarded as a complex, concrete, historical totality; i.e. as constituted by an encompassing, intertwined, and layered array of structures of varying degrees of social objectivity.  Aside from highlighting the aggregate trends of global capitalism in the last 45 years, I characterize the development of its international structure in the period.  The theoretical framework utilized is explicitly Marxian.  In this stage, the main empirical material on which description and explanation are based is the Penn World Tables 9.0, the largest and most reputable set of internationally comparable national-accounting statistics available today.
