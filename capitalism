Relatively lasting restrictions on competition can exist, be that as an outcome of competition itself the number of organized individual capitals decreases in particular industries, the initial level of capital required increases making it impossible for a number of dispersed individual capitals to enter an industry, or because the state limits competition via regulation, taxation, etc.  Yet the essential capitalist character of society remains unaltered.  In brief, capitalism is compatible with significant curbs on the prerrogatives of individual private capitals.

Society remains capitalist insofar as the ownership over the means of production and labor power are divorced, i.e. insofar as markets, though not necessarily ``free'' and ``competitive'' markets, predominate and there is significant social inequality so the mass of the direct producers is largely dispossed and, therefore, must sell their labor force as a commodity in the markets.  This can be the case under a range of different configurations regarding the interactions among individual capitals and between private capitals and the state.

However, in the long run, social inequality cannot be reduced beyond a critical point, a critical mass of means of production cannot be effectively owned by the direct producers, personally or jointly, without the rule of capital collapsing.  A significant degree of social inequality is sine qua non for the existence and dominance of capital over labor.
