Here is, in a nutshell: If TFP is "free lunch" (an addition to output unexplained by the inputs regarded in isolation) then it can only result from labor cooperation. http://www.nber.org/papers/w5348 "As co-operators, as members of a working organism, they are but special modes of existence of capital. Hence, the productive power developed by the labourer when working in co-operation, is the productive power of capital. This power is developed gratuitously, whenever the workmen are placed under given conditions, and it is capital that places them under such conditions. Because this power costs capital nothing, and because, on the other hand, the labourer himself does not develop it before his labour belongs to capital, it appears as a power with which capital is endowed by Nature â€“ a productive power that is immanent in capital." https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch13.htm

A big problem in grasping the issues here is that Marxists tend to swallow the Cambridge critique of capital. Some Marxists see the difference between use value and value but fail to see their identity.

Knowledge is an attribute inherent to labor power. All knowledge (which entails a physical transformation of the "physical inputs" as all knowledge must reside in a material medium) results from socialization. It is an aspect of the process of socialization or social formation (formation of social structures).

If the whole purpose is to measure the portion of extra output that can be attributed to better disembodied knowledge under capitalism, then what is wrong with the conventional approach? The issue with conventional TFP estimation is not so much empirical as conceptual or theoretical. Plus or minus some error, capital knows how to measure itself in its own terms. Of course you need some measure of (to invoke one of the definitions of value that Marx offered in Capital that Marxists rarely emphasize) the "relative social importance" of different use values (consumption goods, means of production, or labor power) under capitalism in order to aggregate even the most "concrete" labor flows into operational measures. The key is whether the relative social importance of things is determined through a process of social formation (value) alien and destructive of the direct producers or a process of, by, and for the direct producers.

That (I argue) is a conceptual/theoretical issue. What they mean by "capital" is a measure of the "physical" means of production utilized: an index of "use value." The objection from the CCC quarters is that they smuggle "value" as aggregation weights in a "use value" measure, which they regard as self contradictory. To me, the joke is on CCC.

Every input in capitalist production is capital under some form -- capital in Marx's sense. Labor power appears under the guise of variable capital. So is (variable) capital productive of capital? You bet is. Is constant capital productive of capital? Yup. Capital is productive of capital, because it exploits labor. (I was also referring to that chapter in volume 3.)

The Soviet planners did growth accounting. Partly they discovered it independently. They fitted translog functions, a Cobb Douglas, etc. on their input-output data and estimated elasticities, which were some sort of benchmark for guiding allocations or, the "dual," "pricing" inputs! When I get home I will take photos of pages of a book and post them here. It is not that they didn't know about CCC.

In general, any output/input ratio is labor productivity in Marx's sense! Labor productivity under this or that form. In the abstract (chapter 1, volume 1) you measure labor productivity by taking the ratio of the amount of some concrete use value (e.g. shoes) to the hours of labor required to reproduce that amount of the use value. But since, to estimate the denominator, you need to count not only the direct labor in the last stage of shoe making, but also the indirect labor, i.e. hours of labor required to produce machines, materials, etc., then you will have to use operational proxies as practically necessary to economize capital. So you will take the ratio of shoes produced to the number of machines or materials or what have you. Whether or not to aggregate machines of different vintage or different kind altogether into a category called "machines" or use each class of machines as a separate denominator in these ratios was an eminently practical problem. In principle, it seems to me that Marx saw no inherent problem to aggregating means of production of a different quality. Witness his reproduction schemes, where he assumes a branch produces "means of production." How do you measure the amount of "means of production"? Why you ask. You utilize values to aggregate them into a single sum. How else can anybody do it? How about inflation? How about it, if you are trying to discount the influence of prices then you flip the equation. You wind up with one degree of freedom. That goes with the fact that the only way humans can measure things is by reference to themselves, to their own humanity, i.e. to labor.

Grrr. Once I reread my post I note how obscure it is. Let me see if I can be clearer. The productivity of "capital" is a kind of labor productivity, the latter in Marx's sense. It is the productivity of buildings, equipment, etc., which are "materialized labor." What the BEA calls "labor productivity" (output per worker or output per hour of labor hired in a particular stage of production) is also a particular form of Marx's labor productivity. So TFP is also labor productivity in Marx's sense. It is generic output per unit of generic input (labor power and means of production bundled together under some assumption regarding the quality of such LP and MP, i.e. materialized labor).

Not sure I understand you. From the capitalist viewpoint, holding labor power vs. holding buildings, equipment, inventories, etc. is a "portfolio choice" to get right at each point in time. All of these assets are forms of the same thing, capital, but they are distinct, each of them performs a different function in a given production process. For a given time horizon, capitalists seek to equalize bang-for-the-buck across different assets, and that's what asset "productivity" is all about. The numerator is an expected flow and the denominator is a stock. If at a point in time their asset mixture is deemed unbalanced (and changing conditions will ensure the portfolio is always thrown off balance), capital is to switch from less to more "productive" asset. The "productivity" measures based on the national accounts adjust this because the data they deem more reliable are flow data and the purpose of the exercise is to inform macro policy. So, the denominator is input flows. In this case, if they are estimating "capital productivity" (i.e. the "productivity" of buildings, equipment, and inventories across an economy), then an estimate of the wear and tear (depreciation) of the fixed assets and the cost of the productive consumption of inventories go in the denominator. Now, in the exercises conducted by academic and government economists, they try to ascertain the "productivities" (output/input ratios) of more or less disaggregated inputs. So they may have estimates of "unskilled" labor, generic "capital" buildings, equipment, inventories, etc. They may also have estimates of the extent to which the "quality" of "unskilled" labor and generic "capital" may improve from period to period. These improvements in quality are knowledge or technology embodied in better workers or better "machines." So if from one year to the next output grows, then by the conservation law of physics that extra output must come from somewhere. These appear to be the possibilities: The extra output comes from more "unskilled" labor, more generic "capital," better labor, or better "capital." However, as precisely as they tried to measure each of these components, the economists always ended up with additional input that they could not attribute to any of these four broad categories: the "residual." Some of them said, again, by the conservation law, no thing can come from nothing. So we must be mis-measuring inputs. Others argued, that is the result of combining the previous four categories of inputs in a better way. Knowledge "embodied" not in better discrete physical inputs but in their combination regarded as a whole. Hence "total" factor productivity. Take the existing combination of productive assets in the economy. Now, expand its entire scale (not one asset while keeping the others fixed, but all of them pari passu). In their view, if there is a residual, then that residual must result from the expanded scale of these four categories of inputs altogether: "total" indeed. In my view, this is largely a scholastic dispute. In the universe, as I understand it, the only way in which a system can push back on entropy is by combination and cooperation ("organization"). This is by definition. As Georgescu-Roegen argued, the second law is anthropocentric; it is about the usability of matter or energy *for* humans. Matter or energy is more usable to humans insofar as it incorporates more humanity (labor), insofar as it increases the productive power of labor (society is basically a device that produces labor power by means of labor power), insofar as it is more "organized." Entropy is defined as the negative of organization. How do humans produce more wealth if not by helping one another (cooperation)? If in the open system we call society organization increases it must be because entropy in the universe as a whole increases at a higher speed than otherwise. There's no magic.

One short addendum: At the aggregate, measuring outputs and inputs in money terms is tantamount to measuring them in labor time terms, plus or minus an error. But monetary units this year may buy more or less stuff than last year. Indeed. So what? An hour of labor this year may "buy" (produce) more or less stuff than last year as well. If you're trying to deflate the measures (to estimate stuff/stuff productivity ratios), then you can only fix one of these two variables, not both at once. Again, you end up with a degree of freedom, because social life is self referential.

What estimates do you have in mind? To me, conceptual clarification is where we lag. The particular estimates the economists obtain are very sensitive to data samples and modeling choices. The only way to advance in concrete knowledge is by expanding data availability and testing alternative models that shed light from different angles. Conceptually, we need to be careful with the use of the word "capital" here. By "capital," we mean here means of production. According to Marx, labor power performs a "service" for the capitalists, and that service is labor as such, labor as a process over time. A "service" is the use or consumption of a thing, the realization of its use value over time. Do the means of production listed in the balance sheet of a capitalist perform a "service" to the capitalists over the next period of time? How would you call that "service"? Marx referred to this as a process of "productive consumption."

In volume 1 of Capital, the notion of productivity (or "productive power of labor" or "productive force of labor") that Marx advances is use values of some conventionally defined class (e.g. shoes) as a ratio of the hours of labor required to reproduce them, not only the hours of shoe making, but inclusive of the hours of shoe-machine making, leather-making, construction of the buildings in which shoes are produced, etc. In value terms, the denominator is not v, but (c+v+s), not even the work year or "value added" (v+s) alone, but also c (the labor required to reproduce the means of production utilized, even if those means of production were produced in previous years all the way to the beginning of history. Obviously, if you save hands this year, you are saving labor. But also, if you save machines, you are saving labor, the labor that it'd take to remake those machines.
