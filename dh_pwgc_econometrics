Main point: the essential trend of postwar global capitalism and how its structure has evolved.  The rate of exploitation over time, its national dispersion, and its components:
\[
r = e \omega \rho = \pi \rho, \\
\pi = \frac{r}{\rho}
\log \pi = \log r - \log \rho
\]

Interpret the identity as a function, i.e. with $\pi$ as a function of $r$ and $\rho$ over time, and model $\log \pi_{i, t}$ as an AR($p$) process with extra regressors $\log r_{i, t}, \ldots, \log r_{i, t-k}$ and $\log \rho_{i, t}, \ldots, \log r_{i, t-n}$.  In other words,
\[
\log \pi_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log \pi_{i, t-1} + \ldots + \beta_p \log \pi_{i, t-p} + \delta_0
\log r_{i, t} + \delta_1 \log r_{i, t-1} + \ldots + \delta_q \log r_{t, t-q} + \gamma_0 \log \rho_{i, t} + \gamma_1 \log \rho_{i, t-1} + \ldots + \gamma_m \log \rho_{i, t-m} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\]

with $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)

What is the rationale to view $e$ as a function of $r$, $\omega$, and $\rho$?

Over the medium term, the economic class balance of forces is subject to the vagaries of capitalist accumulation, which at the level of individual capitals, is driven by $r$,
