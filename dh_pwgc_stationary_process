On the basis of theory, are $\pi$/$\omega$/$e$, $\rho$, and $r$ stationary?

$N$, $E$, $L$, $L^*$, $Y$, $K$, $W$, and $C$ all exhibit trends (exponential).  Similarly, rates such as $y$, $y_e$, $y_l$, $y_h$, $k$, $k_e$, $k_l$, $k_h$ exhibit similar trends.  

How about $\omega$/$\pi$/$e$?  This depends on the period of time considered.
