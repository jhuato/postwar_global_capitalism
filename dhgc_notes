The descriptive part is about grasping the time trend and national dispersion of the primary and secondary variables.

Questions to keep in mind when examining the data along the time dimension: Trend? Cycles? 

When considering variation across countries:
Has variation increased (int'l inequality, risk)
Also regional variation (rich/poor, geographic region)

Primary productive force variables: N, E, L, H-adj L, Y, Yo, K
Primary economic variables: W, C, and therefore Y-W, Yo-C
Secondary productive force variables: Y/N, Y/E, Y/L, Y/H-adj L, K/N, K/E, K/L, K/H-adj L, Y/K (considered in the longer run timeframe)
Secondary essential economic variables: omega, c, e, eps
Secondary superficial economic variables: rho, r, kappa


Theorizing...

My main theoretical framework is:

e = e(rho, tfp, r or kappa, and political variables, country fixed effects, time fixed effects)
