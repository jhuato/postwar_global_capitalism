Path of global K 1950-2014

Similar story as the path of global Y.

The capital stock path looks too smooth. 

Data sparseness aside, this must be an artifact of the perpetual-inventory method of estimating the capital stock.

NB: 1950s and 1960s, a lot of missing values. Data are unreliable.

Note that global K expands until 1980.  From that point on, except for the blip of 1989 due to the reinsertion of Russia, etc. into global capitalism, decline.

Sudden appreciation of K in the early 1950s (perhaps due to data availability).

From the early 1960s, sustained recovery with fluctuations up to 1970. 

Slow down in the expansion of K in period 1970-1980.

Decline in K from that point on.  

1990-1991: Sudden appreciation due to the reinsertion of Russia, etc. into the global orbit of capital, then decline continues until 2014.
# NB: Growth rate of K during the whole period is .3%/yr faster than Y
# This confirms Piketty's point that K has expanded,
# but this means that K has become less "productive"
