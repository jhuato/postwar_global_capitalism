The path of global Y 1950-2014

For the entire period, the annual growth rate was 4.3%.  This is the result of three expansionary waves.  The first, most prolonged and most remarkable stretches from 1950 through 1973 (23 years!).  In part, it is postwar reconstruction, particularly in Japan, Europe, and the Soviet Union.  But only in part.  And that reconstruction began in 1945.  In part, this upswing in the graph results from the missing-values illusion.  Data becomes available for more countries over this period, which adds up to the global Y.  This is to be discounted, though the availability of data is also evidence of the increasing incorporation of these countries to the capitalist orbit.

But, why did this prolonged period of capitalist prosperity take place?  I have two conjectures: (1) the distribution of wealth ownership reset button was pushed by war and revolutions.  In vast countries of Asia, there were forceful processes of land reform.  In Mexico as well, but before the war.  And, not completely independent from (1), (2) the existence of the Soviet Union provided an extra stimulus to capitalist accumulation via the ``mixed economy'' formula, which partly second-guessed private capital accumulation.

The long postwar prosperity was followed by five global downturns of different sizes: 

The longest: 1974-1989, 
Also brutal: 1991-2003, 
These three downturns configure a sort of global stagnation scenario: 2007-2009, 2011, and 2013-2014

In a sense, one could think of the 1950-2014 cycle as split into two stages:

Expansion: 1974-1974
Historical crisis: 1975-2014

The historical crisis was temporarily reversed by the collapse of the Soviet Union, which explains the sudden uptick of 1989.
