Grundrisse (Penguin, p. 171-ss), Marx dialogues with Smith.  Smith on the ``original price'' people pay for wealth is their own labor, toil and trouble.  

When a particular worker with particular means of production undertakes a particular production process and produces a particular product, you may say that he is ``purchasing'' that product directly with his labor time.  Sure, but only that particular product.  In order to buy any other product, then his particular ``money'' (i.e. the product that she produced insofar as it is exchangeable) has to become ``general money,'' which implies that her particular labor is just a component (socially aggregated) of the society's labor.  His production has to be validated as an element of the general production process.  This mediation has to occur, and among private independent producers the mediation happens via monetary exchange, i.e. through the chaos of markets, price fluctuations, hit and miss, disproportions and their adjustment, etc.  This is in contrast to communal production, where a particular production process is at the outset regarded as an element of social production.  From this point on, Marx goes into a discussion of communism.
