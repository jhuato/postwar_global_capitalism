Marx, Grundrisse (Penguin) on technology, machinery, etc. (pp. 699-ss):

Capital really gets to be capital with fixed capital as a massive phenomenon.  The labor of individual workers now appears as dominated by these large objects.  With the hand tool, the individual worker was a proprietor.  With machines, the worker is property.  The good thing: It will allow workers to liberate themselves.  It's a premise of that.

Under capital, robots, machines, etc. are not means to make the workers' life easier, but to expand surplus labor time!  And the larger the fixed capital, the greater the loss that results from crisis.

Fixed capital as social knowledge, science, etc. objectified (p. 706).

Marx reminds us that consumption is the final purpose of production, even the production of fixed capital.  It only appears autonomous, an end in itself, because capital fragments social production.

Chicken and egg: How a productive level is premise for the proportion between consumption and fixed capital formation to shift in the direction of the latter.  Venezuela, and poor countries in general.  Their dilemmas.
