# Historical materialism

Historical materialism (relation between productive forces of labor and the social relations of production) and political economy (output as value and as the product of capital, class struggle and competition). 

There are two clearly distinctive ways of interpreting historical materialism:

- The productive forces constrain/enable the collective choice of social relations of production.  The social relations of production constrain/enable the collective choice of legal and political systems.  The legal and political system constrain/enable the ideas of people about politics, law, and economics.  Yet, the purposeful actions of individuals change politics, and through them laws, and through them economic structures, and through them technological conditions.  Productive forces, economic structures, and legal/political/ideological superstructure are not different ``things,'' but the same evolving complex society viewed in its different aspects or historical tempos (like anatomy, physiology, and psychology are not different ``things,'' but different aspects of the same evolving human body).
- People change their ideas because changes in the political, legal, and economic conditions compel them to change their ideas.  Political conditions change because shifts in legal and economic conditions lead to such change.  The legal framework of a society tends to conform to economic conditions: raw cost/benefit conditions. This is somewhat plausible: Insofar as you are assuming the absence of socialism, or if you are thinking as something outside of socialism.  The world as it exists in abstraction of socialism.  As a rule, people in our society are atomized, subject to the inertia of existing political, legal, and economic conditions, which are thus because that is what existing productivity allows.  Engels argued along these lines in some of his works.  Marx also suggested some of these ideas. 

Anatomy/physiology, etc.
