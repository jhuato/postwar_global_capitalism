# Lebowitz on state and capital

Lebowitz, Following Marx, p. 327-ss.

Lebowitz notes that, even if Marx had addressed the state after fully elaborating on capital, landed property, and wage labor, as originally intended, his treatment of the state at this stage would remain somewhat abstract, as he left for latter the world market and crises.  And these would have modified the more abstract notion of the state in book IV.

``\emph{Capital} has nly capital as its subject and considers only capital's needs and tendencies but not those of workers. [...] By explicitly considering the `intermediate link' omitted by the capital-logic school (i.e. the side of wage-labour), it is possible to reconstruct Marx's concept of the capitalist state as the object and result of class struggle.  Further, the resulting understanding of the capitalist state as the `concentration of bourgeois society in the form of the state' is the link to Marx's view of the form of state necessary to go \emph{beyond} capital.'' (p. 328)

``[...] inherent in capital's need for valorisation are state activities to ensure the availability of appropriate labour-power at wages consistent with capital's requirements (drawing upon the power of the state wherever `the sheer force of economic relations' is not adequate), to ensure the existence of material conditions of production (where these are deemed `necessary but not productive in the capitalist sense', o.e., profitable) and to protect the fruits of capitalist exploitation through the existence of a legal system enforcing private property rights.'' (fn on ``[...] the inherent necessity for the `autonomy' of the state or of the state as `ideal' total capitalist acting against individual capitals.'')
