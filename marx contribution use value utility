Marx, 1859, Contribution (Google books version, p. 20):

``This property of commodities to serve as use-values coincides with their natural palpable existence.'' This is just not right.  Use value is a relation between physical objects and humans as humans.  In other words, use value is the utility function of the ``neoclassicals.''  And physicality does not necessarily mean palpability.  It may be visibility or perceptibility in general, directly or with the aid of instruments.  Etc.

``Use-value has a value only in use and is realized only in the process of consumption.  The same use-value may be utilized in various ways.  But the extent of its possible applications is circumscribed by its distinct properties.  Furthermore, it is thus limited not only qualitatively but also quantitatively.''  Here Marx is confusing the quantitative size, amount, extent of these objects with the quantitative limit of use value, of their utility.  Not the same.
