- Dialectical progression/hypotheses

One of the most stubborn objections to the use of statistical inference and mathematical modeling is the critique of hypotheses.

Refusing to make simplifying assumptions denies you the ability to learn.

No assumptions, no abstractions, then no orderly way to grasp the concrete.

In social life, as in the physical world, we face layers upon layers of structures.  What is an element of a broader structure turns out to be itself a complex structure.  Knowledge about the structure requires aggregation or averaging or assumptions that negate concrete detail.  But the economy of time in practical decision making is the reward.
