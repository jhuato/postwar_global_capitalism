Rubin's history of thought book on mercantilism and effective demand, Keynesianism (pp. 37-38).

Rubin notes that with the balance-of-trade doctrine, the mercantilists showed that a nation (the public finances included) could expand at the expense of others. So they went beyond the money-balance doctrine to the trade-balance doctrine:

The way I rationalize the mechanism involved is by means of this accounting identity reframed as an equilibrium condition in the context of a macro model with causality flowing from right to left:

T - G = (I - S) + (X - Q).

Therefore:

delta(T - G) = delta(I - S) + delta(X-Q),


or the integral of all this over a given time horizon.

By exporting more and importing less, by investing more and saving less (consuming more), the crown can get a surplus.
