History of thought book by I.I. Rubin:

There was something superficial in the earlier theories of supply and demand, and subjective utility.  The impression was that there was no regularity to price formation.  That all it was about was accident.  Superficiality that left Marx unmoved, so he viewed Petty as more insightful, deeper. In part, their limits were transcended later on.  Marxists have not caught up with this evolution.

The subjective aspect of utility is only subjective if at the individual level.  Socialization generates objectivity of sorts.  Also, the other point I've made in my blog post on how Marxists should have responded to the "subjective school."
